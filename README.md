# Astro + WordPress Starter Kit

This project demonstrates how to use Astro with WordPress as a headless CMS, creating a fast, static site with dynamic content.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ [slug].astro
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

- `src/pages/index.astro`: The main page that fetches and displays a list of posts from WordPress.
- `src/pages/[slug].astro`: A dynamic route for individual blog posts.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Configuration for running WordPress and MariaDB locally.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
